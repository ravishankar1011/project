Feature: Card Service Card test scenarios for provider Nymcard

  Background: Setup Customer Profile and End-Customer Profile on Card Service and provider Nymcard
#    Given I create Customer, Customer Profile, Onboard to account, banking, compliance, card

    Given I set and verify customer CID1, customer profile CPID1 of PK region in the context

    Then I set the card design config id and card product ids
      | customer_profile_identifier | card_design_config_code | card_account_product_code | card_product_code |
      | CPID1                       | GREEN_NC                | NC_DEB_CA                 | NC_DEBIT          |

    Then I create below End-Customer-Profile
      | customer_profile_identifier | end_customer_profile_identifier | first_name | last_name | region | email         | phone_number  | address                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
      | CPID1                       | ECPID1                          | John       | Snow      | PK     | john@snow.com | +631234567890 | {"address_line_1":"123 Main Street", "address_line_2":"Apt 48", "address_line_3":"Defence Colony", "address_line_4":"Paradise Island", "city":"Paradito", "state":"", "country": "", "country_code": "PAK", "local_code": "800003"} |

    Then I verify End-Customer-Profile exist with values
      | customer_profile_identifier | end_customer_profile_identifier | first_name | last_name | email         | phone_number  | status | address                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
      | CPID1                       | ECPID1                          | John       | Snow      | john@snow.com | +631234567890 | ACTIVE | {"address_line_1":"123 Main Street", "address_line_2":"Apt 48", "address_line_3":"Defence Colony", "address_line_4":"Paradise Island", "city":"Paradito", "state":"", "country": "", "country_code": "PAK", "local_code": "800003"} |

    Given I onboard CustomerProfile CPID1 with customerId CID1 on cash service on below providers and expect status 200
      | provider_name    |
      | HugoBank Limited |

    Then I wait until max time to verify CustomerProfile CPID1 onboard status as ONBOARD_SUCCESS

    When I onboard EndCustomerProfile ECPID1 of CustomerProfile CPID1 on cash service on below providers and expect status 200
      | provider_name    |
      | HugoBank Limited |

    Then I wait until max time to verify EndCustomerProfile ECPID1 of CustomerProfile CPID1 onboard status as ONBOARD_SUCCESS

    Given I onboard End-Customer Profile ECPID1 of Customer Profile CPID1 on fund provider CASH and on card service on provider Nymcard

    Then I wait until max time to verify End-Customer Profile ECPID1 onboard status on card service provider Nymcard as ONBOARD_SUCCESS

    Given I create a product with customer profile CPID1 provider as HugoBank Limited and expect product_status PRODUCT_DRAFT
      | identifier | product_type | profile_type | product_class | currency | country | account_type | minimum_balance_policy | minimum_balance_limit |

    Then I approve the product ProductId1 and verify status as PRODUCT_SUCCESS with provider HugoBank Limited for customerProfileId CPID1

    Given I create account for EndCustomerProfile with id ECPID1 for CustomerProfile CPID1 with product id ProductId1 with bank account type as Savings with provider HugoBank Limited and expect the header status 200
      | identifier | currency | country | in_trust | is_overdraft_allowed | on_behalf_of | metadata                    |
      | BankAccId  | PKR      | PAK     | false    | true                 | CUSTOMER     | {"key": "IntegrationTest1"} |

    Then I wait until max time to verify the bank account BankAccId status as CASH_WALLET_CREATED with provider HugoBank Limited for customerProfileId CPID1

    Given I create below Card Account
      | card_account_identifier | end_customer_profile_identifier | provider_name | bank_account_identifier | customer_address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

      | card_identifier   |
      | <card_identifier> |

    Then I validate card status by fetching card with id <card_identifier> and checking card status as DISABLED

    Examples:
      | card_identifier | card_type | emboss_name |
      | CardId1         | PHYSICAL  | Sukuna      |

    Then I wait until max time to verify Card <card_identifier> status on card service provider Nymcard as INACTIVE

    Then To test the invalid scenario, I update the status of Card with id <card_identifier>
      | card_status |
      | BLOCK       |

    Then I validate card status by fetching card with id <card_identifier> and checking card status as INACTIVE

    Examples:
      | card_identifier | card_type | emboss_name |
      | CardId1         | PHYSICAL  | Sukuna      |
