Feature: Payment Service VirtualId Link and Unlink Scenarios for provider Paysys

  Background: Setup CustomerProfile and EndCustomerProfile profile onto Payment Service

    #CustomerProfile verifying and Onboarding on to payment service on given providers
    Given In Payment Service, I set and verify customer PSCID1, customer profile PSCPID1 on below providers from CASH_SERVICE on behalf of CUSTOMER and expect status 200 in the context
      | provider_name |
      | PAYSYS        |

    Then I wait until max time to verify CustomerProfile PSCPID1 on behalf of CASH_SERVICE onboard status as ONBOARD_SUCCESS onto Payment Service

    Then I create below End-Customer-Profile
      | customer_identifier | customer_profile_identifier | end_customer_profile_identifier | first_name | last_name | region | email            | phone_number |
      | PSCID1              | PSCPID1                     | ECPID1                          | Kiyotaka   | Ayanokōji | PK     | KA@gmail.com.com | 00000000     |

    Then I verify End-Customer-Profile exist with values
      | customer_profile_identifier | end_customer_profile_identifier | first_name | last_name | email            | phone_number | status |
      | PSCPID1                     | ECPID1                          | Kiyotaka   | Ayanokōji | KA@gmail.com.com | 00000000     | ACTIVE |

    # EndCustomerProfile Onboarding
    Given I onboard EndCustomerProfile ECPID1 of CustomerProfile PSCPID1 on payment service on below providers from CASH_SERVICE on behalf of CUSTOMER and expect status 200
      | provider_name |
      | PAYSYS        |

    Then I wait until max time to verify EndCustomerProfile ECPID1 of CustomerProfile PSCPID1 from CASH_SERVICE onboard status as ONBOARD_SUCCESS onto Payment Service

    Given I create account for EndCustomerProfile with id <end_customer_profile_identifier> for CustomerProfile <customer_profile_identifier> from <request_origin> on behalf of <on_behalf_of> with provider PAYSYS and expect the header status <status_code>
